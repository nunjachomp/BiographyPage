    <h1>Welcome to my About Me page!</h1>
    <p>
        My name is Christian Salant. I grew up in Southern California and recently made Aliyah to Israel.
        <br>
        <br>
        I studied BioChemistry at Arizona State University, but made my living as a manager in a number of cafes and
        restaurants. After working in the restaurant management field for 5 years, I am ready for a change of
        environment.
        <br>
        <br>
        Recently I was visiting with my friends in California. We were talking about work and they told me how flexible
        their work schedules were, how they enjoyed what they were doing, and how much money they were making. Given the
        fact that I've worked at the same company as them in the past, I know how good their work ethics are, and my
        work ethic is comparable to theirs. The success they are enjoying in their careers has inspired me to pursue the
        same career pathway.
        <br>
        <br>
        Since I have some familiarity with HTML due to the fact that I am an eBay seller and make my own listings, I
        believe I have what it takes to learn an actual programming language!
        <br>
        <br>
        My hope is that this career pathway will enable me to continue to travel the world with my family!
    </P>
